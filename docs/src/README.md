This is the documentation website for the components library. It is built by Next.js 12, tailwind css and MDX.

To add a new page to the docs, simply add a new .mdx file to the `src/pages/docs` folder.

You can use components inside markdown. These components are defined inside of the `mdx-components` file.

After adding a new page, you should also add it to the navigation sidebar on the `site-config.ts` file inside `sidebarNav`.
