As well as a few others tools preconfigured:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning and changelogs
